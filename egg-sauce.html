        <h3>A FEW NOTES ABOUT THE Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Additional Ingredients: This recipe is for basic egg sauce. You can add more vegetables – green pepper works really well in the sauce. To make it more indulgent, you can also jazz it up with other ingredients like sardines and corned beef.</p>

        <h3>HOW TOMAKE IT</h3>
        <P>Chop the garlic finely.</P>
        <p>Chop the tomatoes, peppers and onion. Or blend coarsely in a food processor – If you are doing this, blend the onion first and separate it from the other ingredients.</p>
        <p>Break the eggs and whisk with a pinch of salt, and keep aside.</p>
        <p>Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan, then add onions. Cook until the onions are soft and starting to go brown.</p>
        <p>Add the garlic, curry powder and smoked paprika, stir for 1 min, then add the peppers and tomatoes. Mix the content of the pan well and leave to simmer.</p>

        <p>Check the sauce and occasionally stir until it is reduced. This should take at least 10 mins, by which time the oil would be separated from the sauce.</p>

<p>Add some salt to taste here. Remember that you have added some salt to the egg already.</p>
<p>Reduce the heat to very low and pour the egg in. Mix the egg into the sauce, then bring the heat back to medium.</p>

<p>Continue to stir with a wooden spoon to cook the eggs evenly. Use the spoon to scrape the sides into the centre of the pan, as this tends to cook first. Do this until the eggs are cooked through and no longer runn</p>
