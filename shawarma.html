    <p>Whether we’re talking elotes in Mexico, dan dan noodles in China, chicken yakitori in Japan, or even a hot dog in Chicago, there’s nothing like classic street food. Of all of them though, none might be more iconic than shawarma. While you can’t beat the experience of buying and eating it from a street vendor, I think my homemade version is pretty darn tasty. My approach? Marinate the chicken overnight to infuse it with a mixture of shawarma spices, and then roast it in the oven until it’s tender, juicy perfection. Served in a pita or over rice (like we did in our chicken shawarma bowls) with some crunchy fresh veg and yogurt sauce, this is the flavorful, versatile meal you can return to again and again.</p>
    <h3><strong>What People Are Saying:</strong></h3>
    <p>"Loved this - I found the flavor fantastic and it was so easy to make. It is definitely on the supper roster now! Instead of just using the cucumber, tomatoes in the sandwich, however, I made a fattoush salad to go with it. it was a great dinner - if I do say so myself, this rivaled going out for this meal."</p>
    
    <h2>What is Shawarma?</h2>
    <p>Shawarma refers to a meat-cooking technique which is popular in Middle Eastern street food. Thin slices of spiced meat and fat (most commonly lamb) are stacked together on a vertical spit and cooked by slowly rotating that spit in front of a fire or another heat source. The result is tender, juicy meat that can be shaved off a bit at a time to serve.</p>

    <p>While the traditional version involves live fire and a vertical spit, I've simplified the process by marinating the chicken and then roasting it in the oven. Since the cooking method is different, my version varies greatly from traditional shawarma, but it mimics the original in both flavor and tenderness–and it’s easier to make at home!</p>

    <h2>How To Make Chicken Shawarma</h2>
    <h3>IGREDIENTS</h3>
    <P>For the chicken:</P>

    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Because we’re using this for a marinade, you’ll want to go for an olive oil with great flavor here. Use your favorite extra-virgin option, or check out our ranking of the best olive oil brands.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Spices:</strong> Shawarma is typically heavily seasoned with a variety of spices, including cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, and cloves. Our version includes ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper for a little extra punch.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Fresh garlic and lemon juice</strong> These two ingredients bring a TON of fresh flavor to this marinade. Stick with fresh squeezed and hand-minced garlic for the best results.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Chicken thighs</strong>We’re big fans of chicken breasts, but for a recipe like this, where flavor is king, you’ve gotta go thighs. They’ve got a little more fat, and as we all know, fat = flavor.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Onion</strong> Since I’m already roasting chicken, I thought, “why not get a little extra bang for my buck and get some roasted onions for my sandwich too?” If you’re not a fan, feel free to skip.</p></li>

        <p>Yogurt sauce:</p>
        <p>I personally love how easily this yogurt sauce comes together with fridge staples, but feel free to branch out. Chicken shawarma also goes great with:</p>
        <li><p><strong>Garlic toum.</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Hummus.</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Tzatziki.</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Halal-cart style white sauce.</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Tahini dressing.</strong></p></li>

    </ul>

    <h3>STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <P>The day (or a few hours) before you want to enjoy your shawarma, start by marinating your chicken. Simply toss together your marinade ingredients in a bowl, then add your chicken and get it coated. Cover your bowl (or put your marinade and chicken in a freezer bag) and stick it in the fridge. The longer it marinates, the more flavorful it will be, so I definitely recommend giving it at least 2 hours.</P>

    <p>Once your chicken has been marinated, preheat your oven and coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Add onion to your marinade mixture and toss everything together until coated. Pull your onion and chicken out of the marinade and get it onto your sheet pan. Bake everything together until your chicken is cooked through (165°, use a thermometer if you’re unsure!) and golden brown. Whatever you do, make sure to give your chicken time to rest before cutting into it. This will give its juices time to redistribute and settle into the meat, guaranteeing every bite is juicy and full of flavor.</p>

    <p>While your chicken is roasting, make your yogurt sauce by whisking all its ingredients together. Check for salt and heat level, and add more salt or red pepper flakes to taste.</p>

    <p>Then build your sandwich or bowl! For a sandwich, try placing a pita in your still-warm oven to heat it a bit, then top it with chicken, some crunchy fresh veggies like cucumber or romaine, then drizzle it all in your yogurt sauce.</p>

    <h3>Storage </h3>
    <p>Any fresh ingredients you want to pair with your chicken shawarma should be chopped fresh, but you can store cooked chicken and yogurt sauce in separate, airtight containers in the fridge for up to 4 days. These are great for meal prepping!</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <p>FOR THE CHICKEN</p>
    <p>1/2 c. extra-virgin olive oil</p>
    <p>juice of 1 lemon</p>
    <p>3 cloves garlic, minced</p>
    <p>2 tsp. koshersalt</p>
    <p>1 tsp. ground cumin</p>
    <p>1 tsp. ground curiander</p>
    <p>1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</p>
    <p>1/2 tsp. ground tumeric</p>
    <p>1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon</p>
    <p>1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper</p>
    <p>2 lb. boneless skinless chicken thighs</p>
    <p>Coocking spray</p>
    <p>1 large onion, thinly sliced</p>
   
    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <p>Step 1</p>
    <p>Make chicken: In a large bowl, whisk together oil, lemon juice, garlic, and seasonings. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. </p>
    <p>Step 2</p>
    <p>Preheat oven to 425° and grease a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Add onion to marinade and toss to coat. Remove chicken and onion from marinade and place on prepared baking sheet. Bake until chicken is golden and cooked through, 30 minutes. Let chicken rest on cutting board for 5 minutes, then thinly slice. </p>
    <p>Step 3</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, make yogurt sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together yogurt, lemon juice, oil, and garlic. Season with salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. To serve as a pita, top warmed pitas with chicken, onion, romaine, tomatoes, cucumber, and yogurt sauce.</p>
